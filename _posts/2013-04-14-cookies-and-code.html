    <p>Planning on going to the Intro to HTML/CSS workshop and wanna test out what you learn? Have a personal project you want to work on? Really proud of something you worked on for class and want some help expanding it? Come to Cookies and Code for code review, advice from some fellow students, or just to hang out. We'll have ice cream and cookies this week!</p>
