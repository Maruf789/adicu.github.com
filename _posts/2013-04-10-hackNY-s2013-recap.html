<p>hackNY s2013 happened at Columbia (for the first time ever!) this past weekend. ADI members created some cool hacks, and member Alexsander Akers won Funniest Hack for <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/spring-2013-hackny-student-hackathon/hacks/ooh-la-wee">Ooh La Wee</a>, an iPhone app that locates the nearest public restrooms and lets you know how many people are checked in so you can optimize your toilet visitage. Nifty.</p>

<p>Other ADI hacks included:
    <ul>
        <li>Zack Newman's <a href="https://github.com/znewman01/instaroid">Instaroids</a>, a hacked Raspberry Pi inside a Polaroid shell to create Instaroids.</li>
        <li>Dan Schlosser's <a href="https://github.com/danrschlosser/compyser">Compyser</a>, a cool python music composer.</li>
        <li>Rachel Susser and Daria Jung's <a href="https://github.com/dariajung/hackny-s13">foursynth</a>, a foursquare based musical synthesizer with an Arduino Micro controller.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>The top three hacks were gitdown (a hardware hack to prevent drunk coding!), AirDrum (a hack that uses websockets and HTML5 accelerometer data to let you play drums with your mobile phone!), and ModMail (a hack that lets you send and edit emails, even if you've already sent it). Check out the other winning hacks <a href="http://hackny.org/a/2013/04/congratulations-to-the-winners-of-the-spring-2013-hackny-student-hackathon/">here</a> and the rest of the awesome hackNY hacks <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/spring-2013-hackny-student-hackathon/hacks"> here</a>!
