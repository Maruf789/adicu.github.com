Thanks to everyone who came out on Friday for the ADI Startup Job Fair! Twenty companies and over 250 students crammed into Lerner C555 to meet each other and talk tech. We hope lots of you got to learn about exciting companies & opportunities here in NYC, and got a taste of what smaller tech companies can offer.
