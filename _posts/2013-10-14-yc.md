Last Monday (2013-10-07), we had an all-star cast of YC affiliates talk about
Katamari Damacy, mistakes they've made, how to get the most out of your
university education, and why *you* should consider entrepreneurship as an
alternative to a traditional career.

Unfortunately, we don't have pictures, but we filled Pupin 301 to the brim.
Check out the speakers here:
