Last Sunday, CORE in collaboration with ADI hosted an all-star ensemble of Alexis Ohanian, cofounder of Reddit, joined by Jared Hecht (CC ’09), cofounder of GroupMe, and Zach Sims (dropped out of CC’12). Alexis, while on tour to promote his first book <i>Without Their Permission: How the 21st Century Will Be Made, Not Managed</i>, spoke passionately about the power of the Internet as an enabler.

### What we learned

Some highlights:

#### 1. The internet is universal and empowering.
<span><i>“The World Wide Web is flat. It’s the world’s largest stage, library … What this new paradigm means is immense power for us all. We have no excuses.”</i> ~Alexis </span>

#### 2. Intern at a startup.

<span><i>“I had to think of how to run a business for the first time in my life. This is something I would not have done if not for Columbia, and New York.”</i> ~Jared, reflecting on his experience at Inside New York. </span>

<span><i>“I spent most of college working at startups and not going to classes.”</i> ~Zach, who dropped out of Columbia College to focus on Codecademy. </span>

#### 3: Learn to code.
<span><i>“How many of you know how to code? Congratulations! You’ve secured a job for the rest of the century.”</i> ~Alexis </span>

<span><i>“This is the most valuable skill in the century; it is also the most freely available and accessible. We can just learn it online. You can all do this. Why are you even here?"</i> ~Alexis </span>

#### 4: Live with uncertainties.
<span><i>“If anyone claims to know what they’re doing, they’re lying, or they are delusional. Or they are just not trying hard enough.”</i> ~Alexis </span>

<span><i>“I didn’t want to waste my 20s doing something boring that had no impact. If you like impact, startups are the best way.”</i> ~Zach </span>

<span><i>“The thing about regular jobs is that people become complacent about what they’re doing, and it becomes a nine to five routine. That may be alright for some people but it just wasn’t for me.”</i> ~Jared </span>

<span><i>“Everyone on this side of the microphone started off exactly like all of you at one point. No pressure, but the fate of the Internet and our future rests with all of you. Good luck on that."</i> ~Alexis </span>

###The Summary
1. You have no excuse to be lazy.
2. Intern at a startup.
3. Learn to code.
4. Live with uncertainties
