<p>
  Get to know what ADI is all about! We'll talk about events we've done in the
  past, programming we have coming up, and how to make the most of our events
  this year. We'll also talk about exciting events coming up, have free food,
  and offer a chance to meet our board.
</p>

<p>
  Join us afterward for Cookies and Code, at 10pm in Lerner 569 to meet other
  ADI-ers, work on projects, get advice, and have some fun.
